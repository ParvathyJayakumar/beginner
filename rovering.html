                  in the United Kingdom who were aged between 15 and 18 years old, was called "senior scouts" <br>
 which was launched in march 1917 during world war.<br>
                  *The second scheme was the series of 'Battlefield Scout Huts' provided for recreation of <br>
                   British and empire soldiers in rear areas of the western fort. Related to these St George's<br>
                    Scout Club for service men,which operated in the English garrison town of Colchester under the<br>
                       leadership of "Uncle"H.Geoffrey Elwes.<br>

                   catered for young men.The first mention of the term "Rover scouts" was by Baden-Powell in the boy<br>
                   Scout headquaters Gazatte in August 1918 and was fully established by November 1919. BP set about<br>
                       ritting a handbook for the new scheme, wich was published in 1922 as "Rovering To Success".<br>
