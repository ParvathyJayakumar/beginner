# Bharath Scout and Guide Wing - School Website
 
This is a simple website I created during my school days to showcase the Bharath Scout and Guide Wing of my school. The website is built using **pure HTML** (with no external frameworks or libraries) and aims to provide essential information about the activities, values, and contributions of the Scout and Guide Wing to the school community.
